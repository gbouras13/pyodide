# `phold plot` Wasm App

**Works with Pharokka AND Phold AND Phynteny GenBank files**

Please go to [https://gbouras13.github.io/phold-plot-wasm-app/](https://gbouras13.github.io/phold-plot-wasm-app/) to produce phage genomic maps using `phold plot` in your broswer.

This app runs `phold plot` entirely in your browser using Wasm with Pyodide - no data ever leaves your machine.

It installs `phold plot` dependencies and runs the underlying Python code in the browser.

All parameters that you can tweak can be found in the [phold documentation](https://phold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run/#phold-plot).

You will need a Pharokka, Phold or Phynteny GenBank file to upload via the box.

This was built during the WebAssembly workshop at ABACBS2025 - you can find the website [here](https://wasmodic.github.io)

It was an amazing and productive workshop - thanks to Wytamma, Torsten, Leo and Andrew for putting it together!
