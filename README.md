# Pyodide Bioinformatics Demo

This app runs `phold plot` entirely in your browser using Pyodide - no data ever leaves your machine.

It installs `phold plot` dependencies and runs the underlying Python code in the browser.

All parameters that you can tweak can be found in the [phold documentation](https://phold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run/#phold-plot).

You will need a Phold GenBank file to upload via the box.

This was built during the Web Assembly workshop at ABACBS2025.

It was an amazing workshop - thanks to Wytamma, Torsten, Leo and Andrew for putting it together!
